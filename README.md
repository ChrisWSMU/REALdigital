From the client:
 
1.      Comparison Chart File – Good month over month comparison, but I’d like to get this to a bar chart format capturing trailing 12-month traffic and sales activity by community.

2.      Email Subs File – Again, I’d like to get to a bar chart format that captures count of email subs by community by month to identify any trends or promotions that help generate these quality leads.

3.      Homes Sold per Community File – Lots of info on this one. Key takeaways for me are % breakdown of traffic source by community, average sales price by community, average square foot by community, and % realtor sales by community. How can we get this into a visual tracker (bar charts, pie graphs) like items 1 and 2 above to identify trends as we go.

4.      Traffic per community – % breakdown of traffic source by community is key takeaway for me here. This month specifically, I was pleasantly surprised at # of those traffic units reporting billboards/signs as source. Helps justify large expense on these directional billboards.

From Lindsey:

The raw data in csv form and the processed data we gave to the client is all attached in zip files. 
 
Below is more of what the client is hoping for instead of just numbers… He wants things more visual.  Everything we submitted was based on how Robyn did it, so I did not try to reinvent the wheel.  However, it seems the client would like to reinvent the wheel and I’m not Excel savvy enough yet to pull it off.  Anything we can do to make the data more visual above and beyond what he is asking for below would be great.  This is all for July’s data.  I will have the raw data for August on September 1st. We do not do this type of reporting for any other clients, but this is our biggest client and this is what they want.  This process is evolving, they just started requesting the numbers this year so this is something new for everyone.
 
In a perfect world, it would be ideal to pull all of this from the raw data instead of me having to copy and paste and put everything into Excel and manually do formulas, etc every month. 
 
Obviously, this data is private so please use discretion with it.
